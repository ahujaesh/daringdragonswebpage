I [![Stand With Ukraine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/main/badges/StandWithUkraine.svg)](https://stand-with-ukraine.pp.ua)

The Daring Dragons destination imagination team's [webpage](https://daringdragons.eshaanahuja.repl.co)'s source code, a backup of [this](https://github.com/ahujaesh/ahujaesh.github.io) repository. Our website is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and is a showcase of our DI team. Instead of making our webpage using Wix or Google Sites, we decided to create it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to customize our site more. This repository is usually updated weekly with backups of the code used to run the website. Our website is hosted on [repl.it](https://replit.com), or [replit.com](https://replit.com), and receives international traffic! (From over 20 countries!)

You can see the most recent version of our code [here](https://github.com/ahujaesh/ahujaesh.github.io).

Thanks for reading and happy coding!


**Changelog:** 

(Note - If you see a version's changelog but cannot see the folder with the code for it, it is currently being finalized and will be posted soon.)

(Note (again) -  if the dates don't line up with the version numbers on the folders, know that I had to rename some folders to get them all to fall under the same naming convention, so the last changed date may be off from the date the code was changed.)

 **Note**: 
 
 if you see some .txt files called "ignoreme.txt" or something, know that I created them just to create the folder that they are in. I don't know how to create a folder without creating a file to reside inside it. If you are reading this and you do know how, please leave a comment or shoot me an email [here](https://daringdragons.eshaanahuja.repl.co/contact.html). Thank you!
