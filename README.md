# daringdragonswebpage
The Daring Dragons destination imagination team's [webpage](https://daringdragons.eshaanahuja.repl.co)'s source code. Our website is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and is a showcase of our DI team. Instead of making our webpage using Wix or Google Sites, we decided to create it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to customize our site more. This repository is usually updated weekly with backups of the code used to run the website. Our website is hosted on [repl.it](https://replit.com), or [replit.com](https://replit.com), and receives international traffic! (From over 20 countries!)

You can see the most recent version of our code by forking our Repl [here](https://replit.com/@EshaanAhuja/DaringDragons#index.html).

If you have a second, check out our [webpage](https://daringdragons.eshaanahuja.repl.co)!

Thanks for reading and happy coding!

 **Note**: 
 
 if you see some .txt files called "ignoreme.txt" or something, know that I created them just to create the folder that they are in. I don't know how to create a folder without creating a file to reside inside it.
