I [![Stand With Ukraine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/main/badges/StandWithUkraine.svg)](https://stand-with-ukraine.pp.ua)

The Daring Dragons destination imagination team's [webpage](https://ahujaesh.github.io)'s source code, a backup of [this](https://github.com/ahujaesh/ahujaesh.github.io) repository. Our website is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and is a showcase of our DI team. Instead of making our webpage using Wix or Google Sites, we decided to create it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to customize our site more. This repository is usually updated weekly with backups of the code used to run the website. Our website is hosted through GitHub Pages [here](https://github.com/ahujaesh/ahujaesh.github.io), and receives international traffic! (From over 20 countries!)

You can see the most recent version of our code [here](https://github.com/ahujaesh/ahujaesh.github.io).

Thanks for reading and happy coding!

**Understanding Repositories**:


Our team has decided to split all of its data across **two** GitHub repositories. Below is a table that we have created to outline the differences.

[https://github.com/ahujaesh/ahujaesh.github.io](https://github.com/ahujaesh/ahujaesh.github.io)| [https://github.com/ahujaesh/daringdragonswebpage](https://github.com/ahujaesh/daringdragonswebpage)  (This repository)
---|---
All the website files (Images, robot.txt, ect.) | Website backups (v12 - v1)
All of the website's data | Website Changelog (What we changed in each version)
Hosts the website through GitHub pages | X
Follow for up to date website information | Follow for notifications on website releases

**Why?**

The reason why we have two repositories is because previously, we used a service called repl.it for hosting, and we only used GitHub for website backups. Eventually, repl.it ended its free hosting (Leading to the loss of all our GSC data), so we had to use GitHub pages (Which is objectively better). To use GitHub pages, we needed to have a repository called <username>.github.io or <orginisation>.github.io, so we had to create a new repository.

---
**Changelog:** 

(Note - If you see a version's changelog but cannot see the folder with the code for it, it is currently being finalized and will be posted soon.)

(Note (again) -  if the dates don't line up with the version numbers on the folders, know that I had to rename some folders to get them all to fall under the same naming convention, so the last changed date may be off from the date the code was changed.)



**v13** (Not final)
 - Update version in README.md's table
 - Add ```lang="en"``` tag to sponsorships.html
 - Add a CUSTOM 404 error page, so that whenever someone finds a broken link, they will email us. View it [here](https://github.com/ahujaesh/ahujaesh.github.io/blob/main/404.html)
 - Add new links to the sitemap.
 - Update incorrect tag endings.
 - Fix README.md rendering error. (Used <> and the file thought it was HTML, so I had to switch to parenthisis)

**v12**
- CONVERT ALL 22 IMAGES TO WEBP (I had been trying to do this since before v10!)
- Update Mrs. RJ's bio with a meme
- Add a spinner to Gokul's page
- Create a new GitHub action to generate the line of code to add new things to the script page since I often use the same template. You can view it [here](https://github.com/ahujaesh/ahujaesh.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/createLine.yml).
- **Convert both locked pages to .PHP** to prevent anyone proficient in Chrome developer console from digging through and finding the locked info. (This took a while...)
- Replace duplicate ```<html>``` tags with only one. (Explanation: When I was optimizing my SEO, I just copy-pasted my ```<head>``` tags from file to file, and the one I copied had an error - one ```<head>``` tag that was normal and one that had ```<html lang="en">``` on it.)
- Update the copyright dates on the bottom of the page from 2023 to 2024 (Four months into 2024...)

- Add new icons to [eshaan_a.html](https://ahujaesh.github.io/eshaan_a.html)
- Add STATES VICTORY (1st place, High IC, Davinchi award)
- Transfer countdown to be for Kansas City Gobal Finals 2024 not Texas State, because States has passed (We won).
- Move JS function that was missed earlier when consolidating functions into one place at the bottom (I'm too lazy to configue a sepperate .JS file).

- Add an MIT license (technically two, one is in .txt format, and the other doesn't have a TLD)

- Added OG (Open Graph Protocol) meta tags to HTML head sections
- Added Google Translate integration to more pages (the [biography pages](https://ahujaesh.github.io/index.html#:~:text=solving%20and%20innovation.-,Our%20Team%20Members,-%2D%20you%20can%20read) )

**v8**
- Improve feedback form styles using FormFacade causing the addition of the reCAPTIA button to the page (I finally found out when this was added on March 27, 2024, ages after this was added after hous of searching for the reason of why it's here, because I didn't use it and I was the only person who has ever worked on this website.)
- Remove all ```<iframe>``` elements for faster loading speeds
- Lazy load videos of our past performances

 **Note**: 
 
 if you see some .txt files called "ignoreme.txt" or something, know that I created them just to create the folder that they are in. I don't know how to create a folder without creating a file to reside inside it. If you are reading this and you do know how, please leave a comment or shoot me an email [here](https://ahujaesh.github.io/contact.html). Thank you!
