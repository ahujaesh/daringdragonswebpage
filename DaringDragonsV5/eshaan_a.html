    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I'm Eshaan Ahuja, born in Toronto, Canada, and currently residing in The Woodlands, Texas. Growing up with my younger sister, Aashi, my life has been colored by passions and experiences that shaped me.
<br><br>
    One of my earliest and enduring interests ignited during my formative years at summer camps focused on coding and robotics. These camps laid the foundation for my lifelong fascination with technology and its potential. It was here that I first realized the power of creation through coding and the boundless possibilities of robotics.
      <br><br>

    Outside of my professional and educational pursuits, my interests are diverse, keeping my life balanced and fulfilling. I find joy in coding and software development, building and exploring the world of robotics, and immersing myself in the world of video games. When not indulging in these tech-related pursuits, I'm an avid biker and runner, relishing the thrill of the outdoors. Additionally, I savor the simple joys of reading and, of course, the essential act of sleeping.
      <br><br>

    My love for reading has been a lifelong companion, with memories of staying up until the wee hours engrossed in a book. This insatiable curiosity and thirst for knowledge through books have been a consistent part of my journey.
      <br><br>

    Throughout my life, four individuals have played a profound role in shaping my path: my parents, a dear friend named Gokul, and my sister Aashi. The unwavering support and guidance from my family have been my pillars of strength. Gokul, a friend since kindergarten, has been both a constant companion and a source of wisdom, showing me new horizons in my tech-centric pursuits.
      <br><br>

    In addition to my endeavors, I actively participate in FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) and serve as the robotics lead for my DI (Destination Imagination) team. In the FTC realm, I take on the role of the robotics apprentice, where my focus is on programming, actively learning and refining my coding skills to contribute effectively to the team's success. You can read more about us and what we do <a href="https://phantom12857.com"> here.</a>
      <br><br>

    "Keep trying" is the motto steering me through life. With a deep-seated desire to work at companies like Google or other tech giants in a web development or coding role, I carry this principle as a beacon of resilience and determination.
      <br><br>

    As I continue my journey, I aspire to turn my dreams into reality and make a mark in the tech industry.</p>
